Config::Record - Configuration file access

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Config::Record;


  # Create an empty record & then load from file
  my $config = Config::Record->new();
  $config->load("/etc/myapp.cfg");

  # Create & load, then save to filename
  my $config = Config::Record->new(file => "/etc/myapp.cfg");  
  $config->save("/etc/myapp.cfg");

  # Load / save from filehandle
  my $fh = IO::File->new("/etc/myapp.cfg");
  my $config = Config::Record->new(file => $fh);
  $config->save($fh);

  # Get a config value, throw error if not found
  my $value = $config->get("foo");

  # Get a config value, return 'eek' if not found
  my $value = $config->get("foo", "eek");

  # Set a value
  $config->set("foobar", "wizz");

  # Get a deep config value (ie nested hash)
  my $value = $config->get("foo/bar", "eek");

  # Get first element of an array param
  my $value = $config->get("people/[0]/forename");

  # Get the raw hash reference forming the record
  my $record = $config->record();

  # Get a new config object rooted at a sub-hash
  my $config = $config->view("foo");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an API for loading and saving of simple configuration
file records. Entries in the configuration file are essentially key,value 
pairs, with the key and values separated by a single equals symbol. The 
C<key> consists only of alphanumeric characters. There are three types of 
values, scalar values can contain anything except newlines. Trailing 
whitespace will be trimmed unless the value is surrounded in double 
quotes. eg

  foo = Wizz
  foo = "Wizz....    "

Long lines can be split with a backslash character, without introducing
newlines. Without double quotes, whitespace at beginning and end of lines
will be trimmed eg

  foo = This is a long \
        line of text
  foo = "This is a long " \
        "line of text"

Multi-line strings can be provided as 'HERE' documents, eg

  foo = <<EOF
This is a multiple paragraph
block of text with newlines
preserved
EOF

Array values  consist of a single right round bracket, following by
one C<value> per line, terminated by a single left round bracket. eg

  foo = (
    Wizz
    "Wizz...    "
  )

Hash values consist of a single right curly bracket, followed by one
key,value pair per line, terminated by a single left curly bracket.
eg

  foo = {
    one = Wizz
    two = "Wizz....  "
  }

Arrays and hashes can be nested to arbitrary depth. 


=head1 EXAMPLE

  name = Foo
  title = "Wizz bang wallop"
  eek = (
    OOhh
    Aahhh
    Wizz
  )
  people = (
    {
      forename = John
      surnamne = Doe
    }
    {
      forename = Some
      surname = One
    }
  )
  wizz = {
    foo = "Elk"
    ooh = "fds"
  }

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item my $config = Config::Record->new([file => $file]);

Creates a new config object, loading parameters from the file specified
by the C<file> parameter. The C<file> parameter can either be a string
representing a fully qualified filename, or a IO::Handle object. If the
C<file> parameter is a string, this filename will be saved and future
calls to C<load> or C<save> are permitted to omit the filename. If the
C<file> parameter is not supplied then an empty configuration record
is created.


=item $config->load([$file]);

Loads and parses a configuration record. The C<file> parameter can either
be a string representing a fully qualified filename, or an IO::Handle 
object. The C<$file> parameter may be omitted, if a filename was specified 
in the constructor, or in previous calls to C<load> or C<save>. Prior to 
loading the record, the current contents of this configuration are cleared.

=item $config->save([$file]);

Saves the configuration record to a file. The C<file> parameter can either
be a string representing a fully qualified filename, or an IO::Handle
object opened for writing. The C<$file> parameter may be omitted, if a 
filename was specified  in the constructor, or in previous calls to C<load> 
or C<save>.

=item my $value = $config->get($key[, $default]);

Gets the value of a configuration parameter corresponding to the name
C<key>. If there is no value in the record, then the optional C<default> 
is returned.

=item $config->set($key, $value);

Sets the value of a configuration parameter corresponding to the
name C<key>. 

=item $config->view($key)

Return a new Config::Record object, rooted at the specified key.
If the key doesn't resolve to a hash reference an error will be
raised.

=item my $record = $config->record();

Retrieves a hash reference for the entire configuration record. Currently
this is the actual internal storage record, so changes will modify the
configuration. In the next release this will be changed to be a deep clone
of the internal storage record.

=head1 BUGS

Config::Record has the following limitations

=over 4

=item *

If you load and then save a configuration file all comments are
removed & whitespace normalized.

=item *

Ordering of elements in hash ref are not preserved across load
and save sequence

=back

These limitations may be fixed in a future release if there is
demand from users...
