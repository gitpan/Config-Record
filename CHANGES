Change Log for Config::Record
=============================

v1.0.5 (on 10-10-2004)
----------------------

 * Fixed dumb mistake which would cause processing of
   configuration file to stop when encountering a blank
   line.

v1.0.4 (on 26-09-2004)
----------------------

 * Allow comments at the end of lines following a quoted
   string, an open/close bracket, an open/close brace
 * Allow long lines to be split with \ to break lines
 * Allow multi-line strings to be input using <<EOF

v1.0.3 (on 14-05-2004)
----------------------

 * When slurping filehandles only change $/ locally
 * Add 'save' method to write a config file back to disk
 * Add 'set' method for changing a config value
 * Add 'get' method to replace 'param' and print deprecation
   warning for all use of 'param' when 'use warnings' is in
   effect (no warnings 'Config::Record' to disable this).

v1.0.2 (on 05-04-2004)
----------------------

 * Fix stupid mistake of missing 'use IO::File' in Config::Record,
   not caught by test suite.
 * Make RPMs builds portable across Debian & Red Hat by forcing
   man(3) install dir to always be $siteprefix/share/man/man3.

v1.0.1 (on 01-04-2004)
----------------------

 * Fix building of RPMs
 * Remove dependancy on IO::File::Cached & File::Path::Localize in 
   favour of letting application developer use these when required.
 * Split POD out into separate file, since MakeMaker (un)helpfully
   skips any file matching /(config|setup).*\.pm/ :-(

v1.0.0: (12-02-2004)
--------------------

 * Initial release.
