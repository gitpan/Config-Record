Change Log for Config::Record
=============================

v1.0.2 (on 05-04-2004)
----------------------

 * Fix stupid mistake of missing 'use IO::File' in Config::Record,
   not caught by test suite.
 * Make RPMs builds portable across Debian & Red Hat by forcing
   man(3) install dir to always be $siteprefix/share/man/man3.

v1.0.1 (on 01-04-2004)
----------------------

 * Fix building of RPMs
 * Remove dependancy on IO::File::Cached & File::Path::Localize in 
   favour of letting application developer use these when required.
 * Split POD out into separate file, since MakeMaker (un)helpfully
   skips any file matching /(config|setup).*\.pm/ :-(

v1.0.0: (12-02-2004)
--------------------

 * Initial release.
