Change Log for Config::Record
=============================

v1.0.1 (on 01-04-2004)
----------------------

 * Fix building of RPMs
 * Remove dependancy on IO::File::Cached & File::Path::Localize in 
   favour of letting application developer use these when required.
 * Split POD out into separate file, since MakeMaker (un)helpfully
   skips any file matching /(config|setup).*\.pm/ :-(

v1.0.0: (12-02-2004)
--------------------

 * Initial release.
